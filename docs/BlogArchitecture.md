# Blog Architecture

## Why

A blog will allow documentation and sharing of my work and learnings. Hopefully, the blog posts will be useful to others and perhaps it will be useful to my future self as well.

The learning pyramid states that the most effective method of learning is by teaching others. Writing a blog post to teach others about a recently learned topic  will increase personal understanding and retention.

One of the founders of Stack Overflow also suggests to "do it in public". For example, if you are creating an app for yourself to help with a personal task, then you should also publish the app to the app store. Doing things in public will give you more exposure, increase your reach, increase your standards (people generally don't want to look dumb to others) and increase your luck surface area - you will have more opportunities.

Writing a blog will force me to organize my thoughts in an understandable manner and also practice my documentation skills.

## What

* Each blog post should have a title, date authored, content, tags, and comments
